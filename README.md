# Algorithm Challenge #40 – Join String (Function Overloading) | Level 3

🧮 Problem Description  
-
This program demonstrates **function overloading** by implementing
multiple versions of a `JoinString` function.

Both functions perform the same logical operation — joining strings
with a delimiter — but operate on different data structures:
- A vector of strings
- A traditional array of strings

---

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Understanding function overloading in C++
- Designing consistent APIs
- Working with vectors vs arrays
- Compiler decision-making based on function signatures
- Writing reusable and flexible utility functions

---

🧩 Example Output
-
**Vector Join:**
Mohammed - Fahad - Salim - Alya

**Array Join:**
Mohammed : Fahad : Salim : Alya

📂 File Information
-
- **Language:** C++
- **File Name:** join_string_overloading.cpp
- **Challenge Level:** Level 3
- **Challenge Number:** #40

💬 Notes
-
Function overloading improves:
- Code readability
- API usability
- Developer experience

It allows programmers to think in terms of *what the function does*,
not *how the data is stored*.
